# Emulator regression test debt

This file records regression coverage deferred during fast launch bring-up. Each item
describes a guest contract rather than a title-specific workaround. Deferred tests must
be added before the corresponding fixes are proposed upstream.

## Unsigned bitfield selectors for bounded resource tables

Status: production fix and corpus validation in progress; automated regression deferred.

Observed trigger: a four-word buffer descriptor is loaded from an immutable table using
an index produced by `BitFieldUExtract`. The source of the extracted bits can be
lane-varying, including a buffer lookup indexed by `WorkgroupId`, while an immediate
unsigned extraction still gives an exact dense range of `0..(2^width - 1)`.

Required tests:

- A compiler-level proof test where a 5-bit extraction drives four correlated descriptor
  reads with stride 16 and produces exactly 32 candidates.
- A materialization test that reads all correlated descriptor words coherently, deduplicates
  identical candidates, preserves the live GPU selector, and maps each key to the right buffer.
- Boundary cases for width 0, width 32, invalid `offset + width`, non-immediate offset/width,
  signed extraction, mismatched descriptor columns, and the existing resource/probe limits.
- A native Windows shader audit covering every captured manifest in the same normalized
  failure group, followed by a bounded Vulkan readback case before upstream submission.
